# Dimensionality Reduction of Biometric Image Recognition

The aim of the project is to reduce the dimensionality of the occluded biometric face images so that we could store and search efficiently. The main purpose is to use lesser space and better retrieval of images. For this sake, we will use the techniques used in locality sensitive hashing (LSH), minimal loss hashing (MLH) and iterative quantization (ITQ) where the data vector when randomly projected will be generating hyper-plane.
